This is a Wordpress site I cooked up for my disc golf club. It's a pretty basic site but that allowed me to make a really clean and tidy theme. The funnest part was the plugin that consumes Yahoo's XML weather feed and displays the corresponding part of an image sprite. See http://torontoislanddiscgolfexperience.com/
